# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

This repository contains documentation regarding the **SEALFAIL project.**

The SEALFAIL project aims to deliver a hardened Linux distribution suitable for use cases requiring strict operational, information, and communication security (**OPSEC**, **INFOSEC**, and **COMSEC**) in the face of high-level threat actors.

The SEALFAIL operating system is developped with change in mind. The intended users are political activists, NGO field agents, partisans, and all those who organize and fight against authoritarian regimes and surveillance capitalism, and/or for human rights and dignity.

What SEALFAIL is not is a solution to all the aforementioned threats. SEALFAIL is a tool to be used when facing such threats. Proper OPSEC, INFOSEC, and COMSEC are achieved through more than operating system selection. **Do not rely solely on SEALFAIL to ensure your security requirements are met.**
